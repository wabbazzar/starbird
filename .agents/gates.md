# Verification gates — starbird

> The single source of truth for **how to prove a change works on this
> project**. `polish-ticket` reads this file to assemble the per-phase
> verification surface; `execute-ticket` reads it to know which gates to run
> before every commit. There is no one test command that covers everything —
> a phase declares which of the classes below apply, and this file supplies
> the exact commands.
>
> The installer drops this template into `<project>/.agents/gates.md` and
> never clobbers an existing copy. Fill in the placeholders, delete the gate
> classes that don't apply, and grow the **Traps** appendix over time.

## Commands (fill these in)

| What | Command |
|---|---|
| Test suite | `<e.g. npm run test / .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q>` |
| Typecheck / lint | `<e.g. npx tsc --noEmit / ruff check / py_compile core modules>` |
| Build | `<e.g. npm run build / cargo build / n-a>` |
| Notify (owner alert) | `$QUARTET_NOTIFY_CMD` (baked into units at install; a wrapper that pages the owner — the ONLY notification path) |
| Event stream dir | `$QUARTET_EVENTS_DIR` (append-only JSONL, one `job.*` / incident object per line) |

## Gate classes — mark which apply, keep the exact commands

Delete any class this project doesn't have. For each phase, the ticket names
which of these apply; "the code looks right" is never proof.

### Shell scripts  — APPLIES: yes / no
`bash -n` every touched script, then **run it for real** and read the output
(exit codes + printed values, not vibes). Scripts with a `--check` / `--dry-run`
flag: run that too.

### systemd (user) units  — APPLIES: yes / no
`systemctl --user daemon-reload`, then `list-timers` shows the expected next
fire, then start the service once (`systemctl --user start <unit>`) and confirm
the observable outcome — a `job.end` line in `$QUARTET_EVENTS_DIR/$(date +%F).jsonl`,
`journalctl --user -u <unit>`, or the project's stated probe. Never wait for
`OnCalendar`.

### Served app at a port  — APPLIES: yes / no
- Dev port: `<PORT>`  ·  Build command: `<BUILD_CMD>`  ·  Restart: `<RESTART_CMD>`
- **Stale-bundle trap:** the service serves the *built* bundle, not a live dev
  server — rebuild + restart after every source edit, then
  `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>/<route>`
  must return 200 before "done".
- If this is a phone/PWA surface, render the changed view at **mobile viewport**
  with a headless browser and actually look at it — desktop-width "looks fine"
  is not evidence. **Kill the headless browser afterward and verify with `ps`
  it's gone** (a forgotten headless browser can poll an endpoint for days).

### Event stream / notifications  — APPLIES: yes / no
If the phase emits events, read the actual JSONL line in
`$QUARTET_EVENTS_DIR/$(date +%F).jsonl`. If it notifies, either confirm one real
`$QUARTET_NOTIFY_CMD` send or deliberately stub it (say which in the Ledger) —
don't spam the owner from a loop.

### Sibling / cross-repo work  — APPLIES: yes / no
List each sibling repo this project's tickets touch, its own gate, and its
deploy hazard:

| Repo | Gate command | Hazard |
|---|---|---|
| `<sibling-repo>` | `<its leak-check / test cmd>` | `<e.g. merge-is-live: units run runners from this clone, so a merge to trunk is fleet-live at the next timer fire — work on a branch until tested>` |

### Live-system changes (firewall / cron / containers / packages)  — APPLIES: yes / no
For each such change, write BOTH the verify command and the rollback command in
the ticket **before** making the change (e.g. `nft list table …` + the delete
command; `docker ps` + the stop command; probe the port + revert).

## Traps that have bitten this project  (append-only; starts empty)

The accreted incident history for this project. Every burned session becomes a
line here so no future caller — agent or human — repeats it. This is the
project's **learning surface**: operator corrections and post-mortems land here
as reviewable, revertable edits.
